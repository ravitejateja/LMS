steps:
create spring boot microservices 
enrollment-service, course-service, user-service
create docker images for all 3 services 
create deployment yaml files for all services 
create ingress ngnix gateway
verify application
----------------------------------
minikube start or stop
minikube dashboard
kubectl kubectl apply -f enrollment-svc-k8.yaml  do same for all services
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml for ingress

>minikube tunnel   // to access url via tunnel as k8 running inside docker

// get ingress gateway url by this 
minikube service ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx
then hit like below http://127.0.0.1:61498/enroll/101/501

---
optional steps
minikube service enrollment-service --url  to get direct docker url (http://127.0.0.1:61737)
* service default/enrollment-service has no node port
! Services [default/enrollment-service] have type "ClusterIP" not meant to be exposed, however for local development minikube allows you to access this !
http://127.0.0.1:61737
! Because you are using a Docker driver on windows, the terminal needs to be open to run it.
